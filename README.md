# MuseScore Dataset Generator

This repository contains scripts for generating the beat horizontal location annotation based on the sheet music generated by MuseScore and the time-beat correspondence annotation based on the MIDI generated by MuseScore.

# Usage

Several files are used separately to generate the full annotated dataset.

MXLtoXML.py                 - Convert MXL files ('/mxl' folder) to XML files ('/xml' folder)
processRepeatXML.py         - Eliminate repeat tags in the XML files ('/xml' folder)
XMLtoMIDI_SVG.py            - Convert XML files ('/xml' folder) to SVG files ('/svg' folder) and 
                                MIDI files ('/midi' folder)
scoreAnnotationGenerator.py - Generate annotations ('/annot_sheet' and '/annot_audio' folders)
